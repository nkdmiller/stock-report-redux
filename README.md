# About Stock Report

Stock Report is a react application that allows users to search for stocks and save them to a portfolio. The portfolio can be accessed later because it is saved on a local rails api. It also continually updates while running to give you the most up to date information about your stocks.

## How to start Stock Report

To run, please download the zip file and extract to a directory you can access. Then in your terminal cd to the root directory. Run "bundle install" and then "rake start". It should open your browser automatically, but if not navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your preferred browser.
